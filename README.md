# VS Quest

Die Mod aims to add Quests to Vintage Story.<br>
It should also enable you to easily add your own quests to the game as well as your own questgivers.<br>
<br>
If you want to use this as a base for creating your own quests, please have a look at this **[example](example)**. The most important aspects to take care of are the **[quests.json](example/assets/vsquestexample/config/quests.json)** as well as the **[questgiver behavior](example/assets/vsquestexample/entities/questgiver.json#L229-L235)**<br><br>
Every quest in the quests.json can have the following attributes:
* **id**: Unique id to identify your quest in the system
* **cooldown**: cooldown in days until the questgiver offers the quest again
* **predecessor**: optional -> questid that has to be completed before this quest becomes available
* **perPlayer**: determines if the quest cooldown is set per player or globally
* **onAcceptedActions**: list of actions that are executed after the quest was accepted
  * **id**: unique id of the action
  * **args**: arguments for the function called by the action, all supplied as strings
* **gatherObjectives**: list of items the player has to offer
  * **validCodes**: list of accepted item codes
  * **demand**: needed amount
* **actionObjectives**: list of objectives that rely on custom code
  * **id**: unique id of the action objective to check

  * **selectAmount**: specifies how many of the item entries should be randomly selected
  * **items**: list of items to randomize from
    * **itemCode**: code of the reward
    * **minAmount**: minimum amount of that item to drop
    * **maxAmount**: maximum amount of that item to drop
* **actionRewards**: list of rewards that rely on custom code, like spawning a certain creature, ...
  * **id**: unique id of the action
  * **args**: arguments for the function called by the action, all supplied as strings
  * **currently available actions (can be used both as actionRewards and onAcceptedActions)**:
    * despawnquestgiver: despawns the questgiver after the given amount of time
      * args: ["8"] => questgiver is despawned after 8 seconds

    * recruitentity: recruits the questgiver (requires custom aitasks and is used by vsvillage)
      * args: none
    * addplayerattribute: adds an attribute as string to the watched attributes of the player, useful for storing custom data
      * args: ["isacoolguy","yes"] => sets the isacoolguy attribute of the player to yes
    * removeplayerattribute: remove a playerattribute
      * args: ["isacoolguy"] => deletes the isacoolguy attribute
    * completequest => completes the given quest
      * args: ["vsquestexample:talktome", "25"] => completes the quest vsquestexample:talktome where the questgivers entity id is 25
    * acceptquest: adds a quest to the active quests of the player
      * args: ["vsquestexample:talktome", "25"] => adds vsquestexample:talktome with questgiver 25 to the active quests of the player

      * args: ["game:gear-rusty", "1"] => gives 1 rusty gear to the player
    * spawnsmoke: spawns smoke particles at the questgivers location
      * args: [] => none

To convert an entity to a questgiver it needs the questgiver behavior:
* **quests**: list of quests the questgiver offers
* **selectrandom**: if set to true, the questgiver will only offer a random selection of its quests
* **selectrandomcount**: determines the number of random quests the questgiver offers
